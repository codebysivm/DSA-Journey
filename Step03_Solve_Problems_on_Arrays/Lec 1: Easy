##### QUESTION 01 :- Largest Element in an Array
          Given an array of integers nums, return the value of the largest element in the array
          
          
          Examples:
              Input: nums = [3, 3, 6, 1]
              Output: 6
              Explanation: The largest element in array is 6
              Input: nums = [3, 3, 0, 99, -40]
              Output: 99
              Explanation: The largest element in array is 99

          Constraints:
              1 <= nums.length <= 105
              -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
              nums may contain duplicate elements.
-----  SOLUTION :- 
        Method 01 :-    APPROACH : we compare and store.
                        simple and Brute force approach 
                              class Solution {
                                  public:
                                      int largestElement(vector<int>& nums) {
                                          int max = nums[0] ;
                                          int i ;
                                          for(i = 0 ; i <= nums.size() - 1 ; i++ ){
                                              if (nums[i] <= nums[i+1]){
                                                  max = nums[i+1] ;          
                                              }
                                          }
                                         return max ;
                                    }
                                };

/////  EXPLANATION :- in this solution we take a variable (max), which can store maximum number from there.
                      max is started from zeroth index 
                      then we start a for loop and start comparing each number with next one and then if next number is greater then store in max.
                      then we return max at the end.
