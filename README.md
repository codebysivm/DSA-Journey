# 🚀 DSA-Journey

Hey! I'm Shivam 👋  
This repo is my raw and real journey to master Data Structures & Algorithms.  
No filters. No fake motivation. Just daily efforts to build logic, patience, and consistency.

## 📘 What You’ll Find Here:
- ✅ Daily DSA problem logs  
- 🧠 Concepts I’m learning (explained simply)  
- 🔄 Mistakes I made (and lessons learned)  
- 🔥 My quiet grind to become job-ready & build my dev empire  

Let’s grow — slowly, silently, but powerfully.  
📍 From 0 → to wherever consistency takes me.

## 📚 Currently Following:
🔗 [Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet] (https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2)

Tracking my progress through this structured DSA roadmap. Each folder contains:
- ✅ Solved problems
- 📓 Notes
- 🧠 Learnings

Progress = Consistency × Focus 🚀
